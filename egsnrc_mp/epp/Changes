 Version 1.0.0 Tue 21 Jul 2009
    - First stable version with all core features implemented.
    
 Version 1.1.0 Fri 24 Jul 2009
    - Added feature for recording deposited energy on the detector.
    
 Version 1.2.0 Mon 31 Aug 2009
    - Added support for reading *.egsphant files with the #egsphant directive.
    
 Version 1.2.1 Wed 02 Sep 2009
    - Fixed a bug that caused some scattered photons to be falsely labelled as 
      primary photons.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a substantial number of primary photons to be 
      falsely labelled as Compton scattered when bound Compton scattering was 
      turned on.
      
 Version 1.2.2 Tue 03 Nov 2009
    - Changed propagation of photons to the detector to remove an offset of the 
      whole image on the detector.
      
 Version 1.3.0 Fri 20 Nov 2009
    - Dropped XML support for input files and regressed to the original EGSnrc 
      C++ Classs Library input format.
      
 Version 1.3.1 Wed 25 Nov 2009
    - Fixed some minor bugs related to the names of the output files and fixed a 
      bug related to importing *.egsphant files from a different directory.
      
 Version 1.3.2 Wed 03 Feb 2010
    - Fixed a bug related to running Epp in parallel.
    
 Version 1.4.0 Thu 29 Apr 2010
    - Updated to use version 2.3.1 of EGSnrc V4.
    - Reduced the changes made to the original EGSnrc C++ class library source 
      code.
    - Changed the optimization level to 1 instead of 3 to avoid an artefact that 
      would otherwise show up on generated images. 
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the command line arguments -h and --help from 
      having any effect.
    - Introduced a check to make sure that the input and pegs file are 
      specified.
    - Added a new command line option -pr or --parse that parses a given file 
      and resolves all #include and #egsphant directives, which is very useful 
      to view an input file that uses these directives with egs_view, for 
      example.
      
 Version 1.4.1 Thu 03 Jun 2010
    - Fixed bug that falsely labelled some photons as Compton scattered when 
      bound Compton scatter-ing is turned on. This fix was introduced in version 
      1.2.1, but it got lost.
      
 Version 1.4.3 Sat 09 Jul 2011
    - Fixed a bug that propagated photons to the detector backwards when the 
      photon would not hit the detector going in its current direction. Now only 
      photons that hit the detector going forward (in the current direction when 
      they leave the simulation geometry) are scored on the detector. 
    - Removed restriction that only propagated photons to the detector that were 
      going in the positive z direction. Now Epp can be used to analyze 
      backscatter as well.
    - Fixed phantom_10cm.egsphant, which was an air cylinder inside water 
      instead of a water cylinder inside air.

 Version 1.4.3 Sat 09 Jul 2011
    - Fixed a bug that did not free some allocated memory.
