 Installation
 ============
 
 Epp has been designed to run in a Linux environment and has only been tested 
 under Linux. The source code of Epp is available online at <URL>.
 
 
 Requirements
 ============
 
 Epp is a user code for EGSnrc and thus requires EGSnrc to be installed and 
 fully configured. This version of Epp was only tested with EGSnrc V4 2.3.1. 
 EGSnrc can be obtained free of charge from 
 http://irs.inms.nrc.ca/software/egsnrc/. Since Epp is derived from the EGSnrc 
 C++ class library, the class library must have been successfully compiled prior 
 to compiling Epp. The EGSnrc C++ class library is part of the EGSnrc 
 distribution package and should be automatically compiled during the 
 installation process.
 
 
 Installing Epp
 ==============
 
 To install Epp on your Linux system, follow these steps:
 
 1.	Download (http://irs.inms.nrc.ca/software/egsnrc/) and install the EGSnrc V4
    code system version 2.3.1 and make sure it is fully configured, i.e. all the 
    environment variables are set, this may require you to logout and login 
    again; note that you need to have a FORTRAN, C and C++ compiler installed on 
    your system, see the EGSnrc website for more information

 2. Download (http://www.physics.umanitoba.ca/~elbakri/epp) the Epp source code 
    and extract the folder Epp into your EGS_HOME directory (typically egsnrc 
    or egsnrc_mp)
    
 3. Change into the Epp directory, e.g. /home/user/egsnrc/Epp, and run make,
    for example:
    $ cd /home/user/egsnrc/Epp
    $ make


 If the above steps have all been successfully completed, Epp should now be 
 completely installed on your system and ready to be used.
